# Page Fragments

Page Fragments are chunks of code, composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, that are used to build [Content Pages](../../02-creating-pages/03-content-page-elements.md). Each Page Fragment adds functionality to the page. Several default Page Fragments are included with Liferay Portal that you can use to build basic page elements such as carousels and cards. Many projects can be completed using just these default Page Fragments. However, you may require a more custom component, in which case you can create your own Page Fragments using the built-in [Page Fragment editor](./05-the-page-fragments-editor.md), or you can create them locally from your desktop with the [CLI](TODO). For a deeper dive into creating a custom Page Fragment, see [Developing Page Fragments](TODO).

Along with standard web development tools (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), developers can also embed widgets and provide fields containing text and images that can be edited during the final Content Page publication process. You can also include resources in Page Fragment Collections that your Page Fragments can reference. Once added, you can reference resources from your Page Fragment's code without worrying about their availability. This is helpful when moving Page Fragments. See [Including Default Resources in Page Fragments](TODO) for more information.
