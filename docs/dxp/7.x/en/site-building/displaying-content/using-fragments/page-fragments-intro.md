# Page Fragments

Page Fragments are chunks of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that when combined together, build [Content Pages](../../creating-pages/content-pages-overview.md). Each Page Fragment adds functionality to the page. Several default Page Fragments that you can use to build basic page elements such as carousels and cards ship with Liferay DXP.

You may, however, require custom fragments. You can create your own Page Fragments using the built-in [Page Fragment editor](./the-page-fragments-editor.md), or locally from your desktop with the [Fragments Toolkit](../../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/developing-page-fragments-with-the-fragments-toolkit.md). For a deeper dive into creating a custom Page Fragment, see [Developing Page Fragments](../../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/developing-fragments-intro.md).

Developers can also embed Liferay widgets and fields containing text and images. You can use these during the final Content Page publication process to provide your own content.

<!-- Before the below paragraph, introduce the concept of Page Fragment Collections, which you haven't described yet. --> 

You can also include resources in Page Fragment Collections that your Page Fragments can reference. Once added, you can reference resources from your Page Fragment's code without worrying about their availability. This is helpful when moving Page Fragments. See [Including Default Resources in Page Fragments](../../developer-guide/developing-page-fragments/including-default-resources-with-fragments.md) for more information.
